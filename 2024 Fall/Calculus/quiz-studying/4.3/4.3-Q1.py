### RULE: Every problem must be solved through step-by-step using Calculus while providing the name of the concept used. ###
### RULE: Work the problem through as if you're teaching someone in a Calculus class. ###
### RULE: Create matplotlib graphics for each step to deeply elaborate the steps. ###
### RULE: You MUST come to a definitive answer and stopping point. Think carefully to determine if the problem has been solved. ###
### RULE: If a problem is complex, break it down into manageable parts. ###

# For what values of x is the graph of y = xe^(-4x) concave down?
# Give answer in interval notation.

# Concept:
## To find the concavity of a function, we need to find the second derivative of the function and determine where it is negative.

# Given function:
## f(x) = xe^(-4x)

# First derivative:
## f'(x) = e^(-4x) - 4xe^(-4x)

# Second derivative:
## f''(x) = 16xe^(-4x) - 8e^(-4x)

# To find the concavity of the function, we need to find where the second derivative is negative.
## 16xe^(-4x) - 8e^(-4x) < 0
## 8e^(-4x)(2x - 1) < 0
## e^(-4x)(2x - 1) < 0 (What happens to the 8?) answer: 8 is positive, so it doesn't affect the sign of the inequality.
## e^(-4x) > 0 and 2x - 1 < 0 (explain) answer: e^(-4x) is always positive, so we only need to consider 2x - 1 < 0.

# Solve 2x - 1 < 0
## 2x < 1
## x < 1/2

# The graph of y = xe^(-4x) is concave down for x < 1/2.

# Answer:
## (-âˆž, 1/2)

# Let's visualize the function and the concavity of the function.
