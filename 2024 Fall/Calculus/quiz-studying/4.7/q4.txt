To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the rectangular field that minimize the total length of fence used. The total length of fence includes the perimeter of the rectangle plus the additional fence that divides the field in half.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( L \) be the length of the rectangle.
   - Let \( W \) be the width of the rectangle.

2. **Area Constraint:**
   - The area of the rectangle is given as 3,000,000 square feet.
   - Therefore, \( L \times W = 3,000,000 \).

3. **Fence Length Calculation:**
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is \( 2L + 2W \).
   - The additional fence that divides the field in half, parallel to one side, will be equal to the length of one of the sides that it is parallel to. Let's assume it is parallel to the width \( W \). So, the additional fence length is \( L \).

4. **Total Fence Length:**
   - The total length of fence required is the sum of the perimeter and the additional fence:
     \[
     \text{Total Fence Length} = 2L + 2W + L = 3L + 2W
     \]

5. **Express \( W \) in Terms of \( L \):**
   - From the area constraint, we have:
     \[
     W = \frac{3,000,000}{L}
     \]

6. **Substitute \( W \) into the Total Fence Length Equation:**
   - Substitute \( W = \frac{3,000,000}{L} \) into the total fence length equation:
     \[
     \text{Total Fence Length} = 3L + 2 \left( \frac{3,000,000}{L} \right)
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Fence Length} = 3L + \frac{6,000,000}{L}
     \]

7. **Minimize the Total Fence Length:**
   - To find the minimum total fence length, we take the derivative of the total fence length with respect to \( L \) and set it to zero:
     \[
     \frac{d}{dL} \left( 3L + \frac{6,000,000}{L} \right) = 3 - \frac{6,000,000}{L^2}
     \]
     \[
     3 - \frac{6,000,000}{L^2} = 0
     \]
     \[
     3 = \frac{6,000,000}{L^2}
     \]
     \[
     L^2 = \frac{6,000,000}{3}
     \]
     \[
     L^2 = 2,000,000
     \]
     \[
     L = \sqrt{2,000,000} = 1000\sqrt{2}
     \]

8. **Find \( W \):**
   - Using \( W = \frac{3,000,000}{L} \):
     \[
     W = \frac{3,000,000}{1000\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3,000,000}{1000 \cdot 1.414} \approx 2121.32
     \]

9. **Calculate the Total Fence Length:**
   - Substitute \( L \) and \( W \) back into the total fence length equation:
     \[
     \text{Total Fence Length} = 3L + 2W
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Fence Length} = 3 \times 1000\sqrt{2} + 2 \times 2121.32
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Fence Length} \approx 3 \times 1414.21 + 2 \times 2121.32
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Fence Length} \approx 4242.64 + 4242.64
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Fence Length} \approx 8485.28 \text{ feet}
     \]

Therefore, the shortest length of fence that the rancher can use is approximately **8485.28 feet**.
