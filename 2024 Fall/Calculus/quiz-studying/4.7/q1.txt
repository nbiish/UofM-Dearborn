To solve this problem, we need to maximize the area of a rectangle that is enclosed by a fence on three sides (since one side is up against a wall). Let's break down the steps:

### Step 1: Define the Variables
- Let \( l \) be the length of the rectangle (the side parallel to the wall).
- Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle (the sides perpendicular to the wall).

### Step 2: Set Up the Perimeter Equation
Since the fence is only on three sides (two widths and one length), the perimeter equation is:
\[ 2w + l = 40 \]

### Step 3: Express the Length in Terms of the Width
Solve the perimeter equation for \( l \):
\[ l = 40 - 2w \]

### Step 4: Write the Area Equation
The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by:
\[ A = l \times w \]
Substitute \( l \) from the previous step:
\[ A = (40 - 2w) \times w \]
\[ A = 40w - 2w^2 \]

### Step 5: Maximize the Area
To find the maximum area, we need to find the vertex of the quadratic function \( A = 40w - 2w^2 \). The general form of a quadratic function is \( ax^2 + bx + c \), and the vertex occurs at \( w = -\frac{b}{2a} \).

Here, \( a = -2 \) and \( b = 40 \), so:
\[ w = -\frac{40}{2(-2)} \]
\[ w = \frac{40}{4} \]
\[ w = 10 \]

### Step 6: Find the Corresponding Length
Substitute \( w = 10 \) back into the equation for \( l \):
\[ l = 40 - 2(10) \]
\[ l = 40 - 20 \]
\[ l = 20 \]

### Step 7: Calculate the Maximum Area
Now, calculate the area with \( l = 20 \) and \( w = 10 \):
\[ A = l \times w \]
\[ A = 20 \times 10 \]
\[ A = 200 \]

### Final Answer
The largest area you can enclose with 40 meters of fencing is **200 square meters**.
