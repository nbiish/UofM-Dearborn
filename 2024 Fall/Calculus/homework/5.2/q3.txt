**1. Understand the Midpoint Rule**

The Midpoint Rule is a way to approximate the definite integral of a function. It works by dividing the area under the curve into rectangles, where the height of each rectangle is the function's value at the midpoint of the rectangle's base.

**2. Identify the Given Information**

* **Function:**  f(x) = √(x³ + 1)
* **Interval:** [2, 10] 
* **Number of rectangles (n):** 4

**3. Calculate the Width of Each Rectangle**

* **Width (Δx) = (b - a) / n** 
   where 'a' is the lower limit of integration, 'b' is the upper limit, and 'n' is the number of rectangles.
* Δx = (10 - 2) / 4 = 8 / 4 = 2

**4. Determine the Midpoints**

Divide the interval [2, 10] into 4 subintervals of width 2:

* [2, 4], [4, 6], [6, 8], [8, 10] 

The midpoints of these subintervals are:

* x₁ = 3, x₂ = 5, x₃ = 7, x₄ = 9

**5. Evaluate the Function at Each Midpoint**

* f(x₁) = f(3) = √(3³ + 1) = √28
* f(x₂) = f(5) = √(5³ + 1) = √126
* f(x₃) = f(7) = √(7³ + 1) = √344
* f(x₄) = f(9) = √(9³ + 1) = √730

**6. Apply the Midpoint Rule Formula**

The Midpoint Rule formula is:

Mₙ = Δx [f(x₁) + f(x₂) + ... + f(xₙ)]

In our case:

M₄ = 2 [√28 + √126 + √344 + √730] 

**7. Calculate the Approximation**

Use a calculator to find the approximate value:

M₄ ≈ 2 (5.2915 + 11.2250 + 18.5472 + 27.0185)
M₄ ≈ 2 (62.0822)
M₄ ≈ 124.1644

**Therefore, the approximation of the integral using the Midpoint Rule with n = 4 is 124.1644 (correct to four decimal places).**
