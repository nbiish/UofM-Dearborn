# Chapter 1 - The Dynamic and Evolving Earth

## Landscape History
During life of our planet
- earth undergoing remarkable changes as:
    - contindents moved about its surface
    - ocean basins opened and closed
    - mountain ranges formed along continental margins marking where continents collided

- Oceans and atmospheric curculation patterns would:
    - shift in response to moving continents
    causing massive ice sheets to form, grow, and then melt away

- Extensive swamps, shallow seas, and vast desserts sweep across the continents

- Plate tectonics plays a huge role in shaping the landscape and geological history of the earth
    - Continental plate theory is very recent ~ 1960s

- Trees with bark came after sharks presence on earth

Geologic or Deep Time:

What is Geology?
- From greek geo (earth) and logos (study)

Historical Geology:
- study changes on our dynamic planet
- how and why events occured
- implications for today's global ecosystems

Princicples of Historical Geology:

There's a defining line where there was dinosaurs and then there was no dinosaurs:
- K-T boundary
- iriduium layer found in the earth's crust at this boundary
- indicates a meteorite impact
- iridium is rare on earth but common in meteorites

William Smith:
- father of English Geology
- surveyor and engineer
- predicted rock layer thicknesses for canals

Formulation of Theories:
- Theory:
    - To the lay person or non scientist:
        - speculation or conjecture
    scientific usage:
        - coherent explanation for one or several related natural phenomena
        - based on a large body of evidence
        - adversarial publishing process

Origin of the Universe:
- Big Bang 
    - occured approximately 13.7 billion years ago (14 billion in class)

- How to determine age:
    - measure rate of expansion of universe
    - backtrack to a time when the galexies were all in one place
- Pervasive background reiation of 2.7 Kelvin above absolute zero
    - called the "afterglow" of the Big Bang
    - remnant of the Big Bang
    - discovered by Penzias and Wilson in 1965

- Initial State:
    - no matter existed
    - universe consisted of pure energy
    - During 1st second:
        - the four basic forces separated
            - gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force
        - enormous expansion occured

    - 300,000 years later:
        - plasma cools and protons and electrons combine to form hydrogen
        - atoms of hydrogen and helium form
        - light (photons) bursts forth for the first time

    - During the next 200 million years:
        - continued expansion and cooling
        - stars and galaxies form
        - gravity causes hydrogen and helium to form stars and galaxies
        - stars explode and form heavier elements
        - planets form from the debris of these explosions

    - Star process:
        - hydrogen to helium
        - helium to carbon
        - carbon to iron
        - iron only during supernova explosions

        # is titanium atomically lighter than iron?
        - yes, titanium is lighter than iron
        - titanium has an atomic number of 22
        - iron has an atomic number of 26

- A mars sized planet impaced the earth at one point and created the moon
    - the moon is made of the same material as the earth
    - the moon is moving away from the earth at a rate of 3.8 cm per year
    - earth days are getting longer because of this
        - tidal lock and angular momentum

- Milky Way:
    - Sun
    - 8 planets
    - less than 200 known moons

- Solar Nebula Theory:
    - cloud of gases and dust
    - gravity causes it to collapse
    - forms a rotating disk
    - sun forms at center
    - planets form from debris in the disk
        - planetismals
    
- Terrestrial Planets:
    - Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars
    - small, rocky, and dense
        - metal and silicate
    - close to the sun's heat
