To determine the number that exceeds its square by the maximum amount, we start by defining the number as \( x \). The square of \( x \) is \( x^2 \).

We want to maximize the difference between \( x \) and \( x^2 \):
\[ f(x) = x - x^2 \]

To find the maximum value of \( f(x) \), we take the derivative of \( f(x) \) with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:
\[ f'(x) = 1 - 2x \]

Setting the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:
\[ 1 - 2x = 0 \]
\[ 2x = 1 \]
\[ x = \frac{1}{2} \]

Next, we need to determine if this critical point is a maximum. We do this by examining the second derivative of \( f(x) \):
\[ f''(x) = -2 \]

Since \( f''(x) = -2 \) is negative, the function \( f(x) \) has a maximum at \( x = \frac{1}{2} \).

To confirm, we evaluate \( f(x) \) at \( x = \frac{1}{2} \):
\[ f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2} - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Thus, the number that exceeds its square by the maximum amount is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{1}{2}} \]
