### Notes
So area is limit of Riemann sum as `n` approaches infinity

## Section 5.2
### Definition
The definite integral of `f` from `a` to `b` is the limit of the Riemann sum as the maximum width of the subintervals approaches zero.

### Terminology
- `âˆ«` called an integral sign (looks like a stretched out S)
- `a` and `b` are called the limits of integration
  - `a` is the lower limit and `b` is the upper limit
- `f(x)` is called the integrand
- `dx` is the differential of `x`

### Notes
If `f(x) >= 0` on `[a,b]`, then the definite integral of `f` from `a` to `b` is the area under the curve `y=f(x)` from `x=a` to `x=b`.

If `f(x)` is positive on `[a,b]` and negative on `[a,b]`, the integral of `f` from `a` to `b` is the sum of the areas above the x-axis minus the areas below the x-axis called the net area. Where `A1` is the area above the x-axis and below the curve, and `A2` is the area below the x-axis and above the curve.

### Example 2
Find the definite integral of `f(x) = 2 - x` from `-1` to `3`.

Graph the integral `f(x) = 2 - x`, `y = 2 - x` from `-1` to `3`.

Area is `1/2 * base * height`
