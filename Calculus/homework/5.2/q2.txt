**Understanding Definite Integrals and Area**

* **The Basics:** A definite integral, like  ∫<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup> f(x) dx, represents the signed area between the curve of the function f(x) and the x-axis, from x = a to x = b.
* **Signed Area:**  Areas above the x-axis are considered positive, while areas below the x-axis are considered negative.

**Problem A:  ∫<sub>-4</sub><sup>0</sup> f(x) dx**

1. **Identify the Interval:** We need the area between the curve and the x-axis from x = -4 to x = 0.

2. **Break Down the Shapes:**
   *  From x = -4 to x = -2, we have a triangle below the x-axis.
   *  From x = -2 to x = 0, we have a triangle above the x-axis.

3. **Calculate Areas:**
   * **Triangle 1 (below x-axis):** 
      * Base = 2 units
      * Height = 3 units
      * Area = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 2 * 3 = 3 square units.  Since it's below the x-axis, this area is -3.

   * **Triangle 2 (above x-axis):**
      * Base = 2 units
      * Height = 3 units
      * Area = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 2 * 3 = 3 square units.

4. **Add the Signed Areas:**  Total area = (-3) + 3 = 0

**Therefore, ∫<sub>-4</sub><sup>0</sup> f(x) dx = 0** 

**Problem B:  ∫<sub>-4</sub><sup>6</sup> f(x) dx**

1. **Identify the Interval:** We need the area between the curve and the x-axis from x = -4 to x = 6.

2. **Use the Given Information:**  You're told the red-shaded area has an area of A.  Since it's below the x-axis, its contribution to the integral will be -A.

3. **Analyze the Remaining Shapes:**
   * From x = -4 to x = 0, we already calculated the area to be 0 in Part A.
   * From x = 0 to x = 4, we have a rectangle above the x-axis.
   * From x = 4 to x = 6, we have a triangle above the x-axis.

4. **Calculate Areas:**
   * **Rectangle:**
      * Length = 4 units
      * Width = 4 units
      * Area = length * width = 4 * 4 = 16 square units.

   * **Triangle:**
      * Base = 2 units
      * Height = 4 units
      * Area = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 2 * 4 = 4 square units.

5. **Add All the Signed Areas:** Total area = 0 + 16 + 4 - A = 20 - A

**Therefore, ∫<sub>-4</sub><sup>6</sup> f(x) dx = 20 - A**
