To evaluate the Riemann sum for the function \( f(x) = 2 - x^2 \) from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 2 \) with four subintervals, taking the sample points to be right endpoints, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the width of each subinterval
The interval from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 2 \) is divided into four subintervals. The width of each subinterval is given by:
\[
\Delta x = \frac{2 - 0}{4} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Identify the endpoints of the subintervals
The endpoints of the subintervals are:
\[
x_0 = 0, \quad x_1 = 0.5, \quad x_2 = 1, \quad x_3 = 1.5, \quad x_4 = 2
\]

### Step 3: Determine the right endpoints of each subinterval
The right endpoints of the subintervals are:
\[
x_1 = 0.5, \quad x_2 = 1, \quad x_3 = 1.5, \quad x_4 = 2
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate the function at the right endpoints
Evaluate \( f(x) = 2 - x^2 \) at each of these right endpoints:
\[
f(0.5) = 2 - (0.5)^2 = 2 - 0.25 = 1.75
\]
\[
f(1) = 2 - (1)^2 = 2 - 1 = 1
\]
\[
f(1.5) = 2 - (1.5)^2 = 2 - 2.25 = -0.25
\]
\[
f(2) = 2 - (2)^2 = 2 - 4 = -2
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Riemann sum
The Riemann sum is given by:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{4} f(x_i) \Delta x
\]
where \( x_i \) are the right endpoints and \( \Delta x = 0.5 \).

Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Riemann Sum} = f(0.5) \cdot 0.5 + f(1) \cdot 0.5 + f(1.5) \cdot 0.5 + f(2) \cdot 0.5
\]
\[
= 1.75 \cdot 0.5 + 1 \cdot 0.5 + (-0.25) \cdot 0.5 + (-2) \cdot 0.5
\]
\[
= 0.875 + 0.5 - 0.125 - 1
\]
\[
= 0.875 + 0.5 - 0.125 - 1 = 0.25
\]

### Final Answer:
The Riemann sum for \( f(x) = 2 - x^2 \) from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 2 \) with four subintervals, taking the sample points to be right endpoints, is \( \boxed{0.25} \).
